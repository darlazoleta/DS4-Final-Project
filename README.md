# DS4-Final-Project
This project trains and evaluates an RF-DETR object detection model on a custom COCO-formatted animal dataset from Roboflow. After 15 epochs of training with augmentation and gradient accumulation, performance is assessed using mAP, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and visualizations via the Supervision library.
